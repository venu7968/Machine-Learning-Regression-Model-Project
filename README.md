# Machine-Learning-Regression-Model-Project
Developed a machine learning regression model to predict the salaries of newly hired employees for TechWorks Consulting, a specialized IT staffing firm. 
Conducted extensive data preprocessing including handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature transformation of categorical variables like college tier, city, and role. 
Evaluated multiple regression models, selecting the optimal model based on accuracy metrics such as Mean Squared Error. 
The resulting model facilitated faster, data-driven salary decisions, supporting TechWorks in delivering competitive and fair employee compensation based on experience, qualifications, and market conditions.
